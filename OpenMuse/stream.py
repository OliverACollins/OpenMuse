Muse BLE to LSL Streaming
==========================

This module streams decoded Muse sensor data over Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) in real-time.
It handles BLE data reception, decoding, timestamp conversion, packet reordering, and
LSL transmission.

Streaming Architecture:
-----------------------
1. BLE packets arrive asynchronously via Bleak callbacks (_on_data)
2. Packets are decoded using parse_message() from decode.py
3. Device timestamps are converted to LSL time using a Stable Clock model
4. Samples are buffered to allow packet reordering
5. Buffer is periodically flushed: samples sorted by timestamp and pushed to LSL
6. LSL outlets broadcast data to any connected LSL clients (e.g., LabRecorder)

Timestamp Handling - Stable Clock Synchronization:
--------------------------------------------------
This version implements a "Stable Clock" synchronization engine designed to prevent
linear drift caused by Bluetooth buffer bloat (latency spikes).

1. **device_time** (from make_timestamps):
   - A t=0 relative timestamp based on the device's 256kHz crystal oscillator.
   - This clock is physically stable and accurate over short/medium durations.

2. **lsl_now** (from local_clock()):
   - The computer's LSL clock (arrival time). This is subject to network jitter
     and buffer bloat (asymmetric latency).

3. **Correction Model (Physics-Constrained RLS)**:
   - We fit a linear model: `lsl_time = offset + (slope * device_time)`
   - **Crucial Difference:** Unlike standard regression, we **constrain the slope**
     (clock speed) to remain near 1.0.
   - **Why?** Pure regression misinterprets buffer bloat (late packets) as the
     device clock "slowing down," causing runaway linear drift.
   - **Result:** The filter effectively tracks the *offset* (intercept) while
     ignoring temporary latency spikes, ensuring the LSL stream remains synchronized
     with the "fastest" packets (minimum latency envelope).

Packet Reordering Buffer - Critical Design Component:
------------------------------------------------------
**WHY BUFFERING IS NECESSARY:**

BLE transmission can REORDER entire messages (not just individual packets). Analysis shows:
- Some messages arrive out of order
- Device's timestamps are CORRECT (device clock is monotonic and accurate)
- But messages processed in arrival order → non-monotonic timestamps

**EXAMPLE:**
  Device captures:  Msg 17 (t=13711.801s) → Msg 16 (t=13711.811s)
  BLE transmits:    Msg 16 arrives first, then Msg 17 (OUT OF ORDER!)
  Without buffer:   Push [t=811, t=801, ...] → NON-MONOTONIC to LSL ✗
  With buffer:      Sort [t=801, t=811, ...] → MONOTONIC to LSL ✓

**BUFFER OPERATION:**

1. Samples held in buffer for FLUSH_INTERVAL seconds (default: 100ms)
2. When buffer time limit reached, all buffered samples are:
   - Concatenated across packets/messages
   - **Sorted by device timestamp** (preserves device timing, corrects arrival order)
   - **Timestamps already in LSL time domain** (mapped via ConstrainedRLSClock)
   - Pushed as a single chunk to LSL
3. LSL receives samples in correct temporal order with device timing preserved

**BUFFER FLUSH TRIGGERS:**
- Time threshold: FLUSH_INTERVAL seconds elapsed since last flush
- Size threshold: MAX_BUFFER_PACKETS accumulated (safety limit)
- End of stream: Final flush when disconnecting

**BUFFER SIZE RATIONALE:**
- Original: 80ms (insufficient for ~90ms delays observed in data)
- Previous: 250ms (captures nearly all out-of-order messages)
- Previous: 200ms (balanced low latency with high temporal ordering)
- Current: 100ms (optimized for low latency based on empirical analysis)
- Analysis of 343k+ messages shows p99 arrival delay is ~90ms
- Trade-off: Latency (100ms delay) vs. rare non-monotonic samples (<1%)
- For recording quality: pyxdf dejittering handles any rare non-monotonic samples

Timestamp Quality & Device Timing Preservation:
------------------------------------------------
**MONOTONICITY:**

The decode.py output may show some non-monotonic timestamps, which might reflect
BLE message arrival order, NOT device timing errors. The timestamp VALUES are
correct and preserve the device's accurate 256 kHz clock timing.

**PIPELINE FLOW:**
  decode.py:  Processes messages in arrival order → some might be non-monotonic
              ↓ (but timestamp values preserve device timing)
  stream.py:  Sorts by device timestamp → 0% non-monotonic ✓
              ↓ (restores correct temporal order)
  LSL/XDF:    Monotonic timestamps with device timing preserved ✓

**DEVICE TIMING ACCURACY:**
- Device uses 256 kHz internal clock (accurate, monotonic)
- All subpackets within a message share same pkt_time (verified empirically)
- decode.py uses base_time + sequential offsets (preserves device timing)
- Intervals between samples match device's actual sampling rate (256 Hz, 52 Hz, etc.)
- This pipeline preserves device timing perfectly while handling BLE reordering

**VERIFICATION:**

When loading XDF files with pyxdf:
- Use dejitter_timestamps=False for actual timestamp quality

LSL Stream Configuration:
-------------------------
Four LSL streams are created:
- Muse_EEG: 8 channels at 256 Hz (EEG + AUX)
- Muse_ACCGYRO: 6 channels at 52 Hz (accelerometer + gyroscope)
- Muse_OPTICS: 16 channels at 64 Hz (PPG sensors)
- Muse_BATTERY: 1 channel at 0.2 Hz (battery percentage, new firmware)

Each stream includes:
- Channel labels (from decode.py)
- Nominal sampling rate (declared device rate)
- Data type (float32)
- Manufacturer metadata

Optional Raw Data Logging:
----------------------
If the 'record' parameter is provided, all raw BLE packets are logged to a text file
in the same format as the 'record' command:
- ISO8601 UTC timestamp
- Characteristic UUID
- Hex payload
- This is useful for verification and offline analysis/re-parsing.
